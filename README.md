Working on a Prototype for a Pebble Face; to show phases of the moon.

--

So far a static moon image and a time display.

Plan: 
 Make a second 'no moon' bitmap that gives a very shadowed outline. 
 Work out how to mask the image; and use an inverse mask to draw the shadowed part.
 
Ideas:
+Date/time
+BT status
+Message Status
+Batt Low.
+Apollo landing sites.
